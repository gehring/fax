    """Find a fixed point of `func` by repeatedly applying `func`.

    Use this function to find a fixed point of `func` by repeatedly applying
    `func` to a candidate solution. This is done until the solution converges
    or until the maximum number of iterations, `max_iter` is reached.

    NOTE: if the maximum number of iterations is reached, the convergence
    will not be checked on the final application of `func` and the solution
    will always be marked as not converged when `unroll` is `False`.

    Args:
        init_x: The initial values to be used in `func`.
        func (callable): The function for which we want to find a fixed point.
            `func` should be of type `a -> a` where `a` is the type of
            `init_x`.
        convergence_test (callable): A two argument function of type
            `(a, a) -> bool` that takes in the newest solution and the previous
            solution and returns `True` if they have converged. The fixed point
            iteration will stop and return when `True` is returned.
        max_iter (int or None): The maximum number of iterations.
        batched_iter_size (int, optional): The number of iterations to be
            unrolled and executed per iterations of `while_loop` op. Convergence
            is only tested at the beginning of each batch. Set this to a number
            larger than 1 to reduce the number of times convergence is checked
            and to potentially allow for the graph of the unrolled batch to be
            more aggressively optimized.
        unroll (bool): If True, use `jax.lax.scan` instead of 
            `jax.lax.while`. This enables back-propagating through the iterations.
            
            NOTE: due to current limitations in `JAX`, when `unroll` is `True`,
            convergence is ignored and the loop always runs for the maximum
            number of iterations.

    Returns:
        FixedPointSolution: A named tuple containing the results of the
            fixed point iteration. The tuple contains the attributes `value`
            (the final solution), `converged` (a bool indicating whether
            convergence was achieved), `iterations` (the number of iterations
            used), and `previous_value` (the value of the solution on the
            previous iteration). The previous value satisfies
            `sol.value=func(sol.previous_value)` and allows us to log the size
            of the last step if desired.
