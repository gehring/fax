            pytree `y`.
        init_xs PyTree: The initial "guess" for the root of

        solver: A solver which takes in some initial guess and some parameters,
            and returns a pytree `x` such that `func(x, params) = 0`.
        rev_solver (optional): A matrix free linear solver which outputs a tuple
            containing the found solution and a dict with any additional
            information about the status of the solution.

    Returns:
        The solution to the parametric root with reverse differentiation rules
        defined using the implicit function theorem.
